Compuational modeling regulation of TNF cytokine secretion
===========================================================
Corpration with Andrew. Model's coding for TNF regulation in LPS, CpG and PIC

## Results ##

### 1. TRIF stabilize TNF mRNA ###

* Increase the stability by 3.5 fold. 


### 2. MyD88 is critical for TNF transcription ###

* Open the chromatin for NFkB binding.
* 

### 3.###

## Todo List ##

- [  ] The score heat map for the secretion and translation 
- [  ] The linked model (TNF + LPS) should works for all the TNF profiles
  (w/wo tnf feedback)
- [  ] The tnf feedback should show much effect in CpG but not LPS and
  PIC conditions for both TNF production and NFkB activities.
- [  ] Solve the delay in CpG induced mRNA profile (fig5d)
