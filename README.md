Compuational modeling regulation of TNF cytokine secretion
===========================================================
 Model's codes for paper (Gene & Dev. 2014, v28, pg2120, [Network dynamics determine the autocrine and paracrine signaling functions of TNF](http://genesdev.cshlp.org/content/28/19/2120.short) , which simulated TNF regulation in LPS, CpG and PIC treatement.

## Results ##

### 1. TRIF stabilize TNF mRNA ###

* Increase the stability by 3.5 fold. 


### 2. MyD88 is critical for TNF transcription ###

* Open the chromatin for NFkB binding.

### 3. Different processing  ###
* MyD88 contributes more than TRIF in TNF mRNA processing (about 3 fold
higher)
