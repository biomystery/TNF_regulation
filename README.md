Compuational modeling regulation of TNF cytokine secretion
===========================================================
Corpration with Andrew. Model's coding for TNF regulation in LPS, CpG and PIC

## Results ##

# 1. TRIF stabilize TNF mRNA #

* Increase the stability by 3.5 fold. 


### 2. MyD88 is critical for TNF transcription ###

* Open the chromatin for NFkB binding.

### 3. Different processing  ###
* MyD88 contributes more than TRIF in TNF mRNA processing (about 3 fold
higher)

## Todo List ##

- [ ] The score heat map for the secretion and translation 
- [ ] The secreted TNF degradation (actually via internalization by
  cells) 
- [ ] The linked model (TNF + LPS) should works for all the TNF profiles
  (w/wo tnf feedback)
- [ ] The tnf feedback should show much effect in CpG but not LPS and
  PIC conditions for both TNF production and NFkB activities.
- [ ] Solve the delay in CpG induced mRNA profile (fig5d)
